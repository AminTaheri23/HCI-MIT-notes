# Lecture 5 - Errors and Controls 

## Human Error

in cognitive sciences two types of error

1. Slips and lapses

   - failure to correctly execute a procedure
   - slip is a failure of execution, lapse is a failure of memory
   - typically found in skilled behavior

2. Mistakes

   - using wrong procedure for the goal
   - typically found in rule-based behavior or problem solving behavior

   60 percent are all flaws are originated from slips and lapses.

**Slips** are distinguished from lapses by the source of the failure. A slip is a failure of execution or control – for example, substituting one action for another one in the procedure.

 A **lapse** is a failure of memory – for example, forgetting the overall goal, or forgetting where you are in the procedure.

 A **mistake**, on the other hand, is an error made in planning or rule application
